\title{setODgenes}
\usage{
setODgenes(object, min_ODscore = 2.33, use.exp = c(0, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{min_ODscore}{the treshold (Z-score) used to select highly variable genes. Increasing(decreasing) it results in less(more) highly variable genes.}

\item{use.exp}{A vactor of two elements \code{c(a,b)}: lower and upper quantile of expression for restricting the selection of highly variable genes. 
Only the genes whose expression quantile is higher than \code{c(a)} and lower than \code{c(b)} will be used for highyl variable genes.
For example, if your clustering is driven by lots of highly expressed genes (Ribosomal, Mitochondrial, ..) you can set something like \code{use.exp=c(0,0.9)} to discard them.}

\item{sce}{object of the SingleCellExperiment class.}
}
\value{
object of the SingleCellExperiment class, with the highly variable genes stored inside.
}
\description{
Computes the numerical model at the core of all bigSCale2 analysis.
}
\examples{
sce=setODgenes(sce)
sce=setODgenes(sce,min_ODscore=2) # I want to use more highly variable geness so I lower the threshold.

}
